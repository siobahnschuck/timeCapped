### **_Description_**

![logo](./imgs/logo_timeCapped.png)
ime Capped sends you on an instant internet voyage.

As an active time capsule any visitor to the capsule is welcomed to trade a piece of media for something out of the capsule. You might uncover
something rare, a personal anecdote from another visitor, or a relic of meme history. Fostered from a deep love of the Voager Golden Record and archival practices, timeCapped aims to be a platform for an internet expierement and a way to instantly ignite nostalgia.

Media currently accepted:

- Images location links
- Links to other websites
- Text of a story, your name, anything you want to type
